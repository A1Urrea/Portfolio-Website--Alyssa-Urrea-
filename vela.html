      <div>Vela allows users to easily comprehend data for users who are new or seasoned to surfing, sailing or diving. With data displayed throughout the app that is easy to understand.</div>
      <div><h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p><!-- open paragraph -->
        Vela needs a way to convey an easy to comprehend data display because users that are new to surfing, sailing or doing may find the charts and graphs hard to understand. We will know this to be true when users start checking the app before they go out.
      </p><!-- end paragraph -->

      <div><h3>Understand</h3>
        <p>
          I started by conducting competitor analyst of the most common weather apps. The competitor analysis will help me better understand what issues users are experiencing. I utilized my findings and was able to create a problem statement.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div><h4>Strenths</h4>
      <p>
        WeatherBug is a free app, but what sets them apart from their competitors is there pollen index9 noting what time of pollen is in the air), their lightning information (how far was the last strike), their ability to support three languages and last of all there customizations.
      </p>
    <h4>Opportunites</h4>
      <p>
        A better layout, something that is more eye-catching. All their information is scattered.
      </p>
    </div>

      </picture>
      <div><h4>Strenths</h4>
        <p>
          WeatherUnderground’s app is very clean, all the general information is provided. With the use of observations from over 250,000 personal water stations world wide.
        </p>
      <h4>Opportunites</h4>
        <p>
          By adding an animated forecast and some color to the app it will become more aesthetically pleasing to look at.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><h3>Observe<h3></div>
        <p>
          This has of the project I conducted surveys and interviews on people I knew that participate in water activities, this helped me better understand our targeted users needs and goals.
        </p>
        <p>

From the interviews I was able to observe that the key feature my participants wanted came down to accuracy. Wether it is, how long rain will last, times for sunrise/sunset, low tides and high tides and so on…They also discussed some of there needs like water temperature, an app that is easy to read, alerts for dangerous water conditions like school of sharks, jelly fish, currents, etcetera and possibly hourly updates that goes past 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>

After I went through the results for the survey, it was pretty much what I discovered during the interviews. All participants wanted accuracy, something easy to use and beautiful to look at. A few of participants stated that their current weather apps they are using are missing features like radar and mapping, humidity %, how weather impacts traffic and ease of adding other places.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div><h3>POV</h3>
        <p>
          From all the data I collected from the interviews and surveys I was able to create three user personas.
        </p>
        <p>

Nikki who enjoys surfing. Becca loves to travel. And Adel who is a recreational boater.
        </p>

        <img src="./img/nikki.jpg" alt="nikki" style="width:30%" align="left" />
        <img src="./img/becca.jpg" alt="becca" style="width:30%" align="left" />
        <img src="./img/adel.jpg" alt="adel" style="width:30%"/>
      </div>

      <div><h3>Ideat</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I have some insight of the users needs I started creating a user flow by using task analysis.
        </p>
        <div>
          <img src="./img/task 1 user flow.jpg" alt="tast1" width="600x400"/>
          <img src="./img/task 2 user flow.jpg" alt="tast2" width="600x400"/>
          <img src="./img/task 3 user flow.jpg" alt="tast3" width="600x400"/>
        </div>

        <div><h3>Prototypes & Testing</h3>
          <p>
            By using the user flow I was able to start sketching the wireframes to create a prototype to users. Once I had my prototype I was able to conduct usability testing on on my prototype with real users so with their feedback I was able to make improvements to better my app.
          </p>
          <p>
            I repeated this process with my low fidelity wireframes, mid fidelity wireframes and high fidelity wireframes.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="./img/lowfidelity.jpg" alt="lowfidelity" style="width:40%">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="./img/midfidelity.jpg" alt="midfidelity" style="width:40%">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="./img/highfidelity.jpg" alt="highfidelity" style="width:40%">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div><h3>Prototype</h3>
    <a href="https://invis.io/JA12B0S1MRSV">Click here to launch the interactive prototype.</a>
  </div>

<div><h3>Typography</h3>
  <p>
    Most of the font used was Helvetica the splash page was the only page using Spinwerad. I used Spinwerad for the splash page because I really liked how the font looked. When I picked the font I was limited to what I had on my laptop. For the rest of the font I went with Helvetica, I like how it wasn’t too flashy and simple.
  </p>
</div>

<div><h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <p>
      The colors I chose were blue tones, I love the color blue so I thought it would look great on a weather app. I had a set of colors in mind in the beginning of blues, grays, white and a pale pink. It wasn’t really working and I took a mini vacation and in the hall of the hotel I stayed at the carpet had a beautiful patters with blues, grey, white and gold and I said “Thats it! That is the color is the color I’m missing, gold?!” So when I got back from my three day vacation I removed the pale pink and added a yellow gold and I was much more happier with it.
